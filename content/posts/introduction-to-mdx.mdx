# MDX: Mixing Markdown with JSX

MDX stands for **Markdown + JSX**, and it's a way to write Markdown documents that can include React components. This allows for a lot of flexibility, making it possible to create interactive documentation, blogs, or websites.

## Why Use MDX?

1. **Interactive Content**: You can embed React components within Markdown, allowing for dynamic and interactive content.
2. **Reusable Components**: Import React components and use them in your Markdown file. This makes it easy to reuse design elements or UI components.
3. **Rich Layouts**: Build pages with consistent layouts, as MDX allows you to create custom page layouts that wrap around your content.

## MDX Example

```
export async function getSource(){
    const response= await fetch ('https//api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
}
```

Hereâ€™s a basic example of MDX in action:

```jsx
# Welcome to My MDX Page

This is regular Markdown content, but I can embed a React component below:

Some more text after the component.
